Another personal blog. This would be a great project to build after completing 
- [Basics of Go](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/go-basics/)
- [HTMX and Go](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/htmx/)
- [Fullstack Go on AWS](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/fullstack-go-aws/)
- built with Go
- built with SQLite (via Turso?)
- uses HTMX as frontend?
- uses [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)?
- could also just be a long-running Go server + API
- each blog post comes from a version controlled repo of markdown files
	- Maybe I should do some research on the best dev experience for a version controlled repo of markdown as a blog.

1. Complete [[API Design in Node.js]]
2. Build a personal blog (API + frontend)
