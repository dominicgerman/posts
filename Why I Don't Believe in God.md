I grew up in a very religious household. My dad was a full-time music minister in a [conservative, evangelical denomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian_Church_in_America) and I had attended a [bible school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moody_Bible_Institute) for my undergraduate degree. I had always believed in core tenets of the faith like the virgin birth, the existence of hell, and the physical resurrection of Christ. In short, I grew up believing that the bible was literally true and the word of God.

In college, I read a lot of theology and biblical criticism and my views on scripture softened. By the time I graduated, I had a much more nuanced view of scripture. I no longer held to biblical inerrancy, I didn't believe in a literal hell per se, and I accepted the scientific consensus that humans evolved via natural selection. However, I still believed in the physical resurrection of Christ. That doctrine seemed to be a requirement of calling onself a Christian. I still held onto the idea that there was a benevolent god who cared about humans and was watching over us.

When I met my wife in 2019, she was volunteering at a hip, Instagram-y, evangelical church in downtown Chicago. At the time, I was working at an older, liberal, mainline protestant church in the Albany Park area. I didn't hide the fact that I thought her church was kind of terrible. I had been exposed to the flashy bullshit of mega churches during my time at Moody and was well aware of the fundamentalist theology that undergirded those places. After we had been dating for several months, she left the church. She said I helped open her eyes to its cult-like nature and started her "deconstruction" process. I was happy for her.

During this deconstruction process, we both were listening to a lot of "post-evangelical" content. Most of this content was from people who still called themselves Christian such as the late Rachel Held Evans, Pete Holmes, and the Liturgists podcast. During this time, I noticed that my wife wasn't afraid of deconstructing as far as needed to get to the bedrock truth. In other words, there weren't any lines she wasn't willing to cross -- no sacred cows that she felt obliged to hang onto. Wherever the truth was, that's where she was going. I admired her fearlessness.

One night during the pandemic, after a couple of cocktails and a weed gummy, I asked the embarrassing albeit honest question "how do seasons work again?" We both knew it had to do with the tilted axis of the earth but I was fuzzy on the details so we pulled up a YouTube video of Bill Nye explaining it. After the video finished, YouTube auto played an hour-long video on the geological history of the planet earth. We were spellbound to say the least. During the video, Torie said something like “Wow, I think I’m an atheist now”. My response was a mixture of “Woah! Easy tiger!” and “I know right? Science is fucking crazy!” 

That video really made an impression on me. Even though I had long believed in evolution, I hadn’t really let the obvious implications of that fact sink in; namely that God doesn’t play a useful role in the modern scientific understanding of the origins of life on our planet. Torie was just pointing out the obvious. My instinct was something like “Sure, but he could have been the one to snap his fingers and set off the Big Bang, right?” But even if that’s true, we’re still left with an incomprehensibly large, cold, hostile, indifferent universe. If there’s a god or spirit or higher power out there that gives a flying fuck about humans, you wouldn’t know it from looking at the data. You need to add the existence of this anthropomorphic entity into the theory — and it feels more like shoehorning him in if we’re being honest. 

By January 2021, I was a full blown atheist. I had begun reading a lot more with all the spare time I had from being home during the lockdown. I started reading Richard Dawkins, Yuval Noah Harari, Dan Dennett, Steven Pinker, Sean Carroll, and David Deutsch (among others). I have to give credit to my lovely wife -- while she wasn't quite as obsessed with the philosophical and scientific arguments against God as I was, she recognized the facts as facts and lovingly encouraged me to explore all my intellectual curiosities. It was such a freeing experience to realize that I didn't _have to_ believe in God for my wife to love or respect me. 

I think that was the main reason I had maintained my faith for so long. I couldn't imagine myself as someone who didn't believe in God at all. It was more a crisis of identity than any real belief in supernaturalism. That's why I think religious people who accept evolution by natural selection are actually kidding themselves in a much more subtle and potentially dangerous way. I remember a conversation I had with my mom about evolution where she basically said “but if evolution is true, what role is there for God?” I didn’t realize it at the time, but she was asking exactly the right question. Her delusion was (and still is) that denying the evidence of evolution by natural selection is an intellectually respectable position. It is not. 

But that’s just ignorance on her part. If she read The God Delusion or Sapiens, or The Big Picture, she might actually change her mind as I did. Maybe I’m giving her too much credit, but at least she’s aware of the precariousness of her beliefs. To paraphrase Richard Dawkins, “If you don’t believe in the existence of the supernatural, there’s not much point in calling yourself a Christian.”

And this is the really crucial point. The more you investigate our best scientific theories, the more it becomes clear that there is only one world, the natural world, and it is described by the laws of physics. There are many different ways of talking about that physical reality, but it is still just one type of thing. 

If you want to still believe in God, that’s fine — just answer this question: “What does god do?” If he does things that are observable/detectable, great! You have nothing to fear and science should soon discover some incontrovertible evidence for his existence. You will be vindicated in much the same way as Copernicus and Galileo eventually were. However if the things he does are not observable or detectable, what makes you so sure that he’s really there? The Bible says so? You just have a feeling? 

I can’t be sure that God doesn’t exist anymore than I can be sure that vampires don’t exist. However, I won’t be saying any prayers tonight for the same reason that I won’t be hanging any garlic over my bedroom door tonight or any night in the foreseeable future.
