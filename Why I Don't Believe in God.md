I grew up in a very religious household. My dad was a full-time music minister in a conservative, evangelical [denomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian_Church_in_America) and I attended a [bible school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moody_Bible_Institute) for my undergraduate degree. I always believed in the core tenets of the faith like the virgin birth, the existence of hell, and the physical resurrection of Christ. In short, I grew up believing that the bible was literally true and the word of God.

In college, I read a lot of theology and biblical criticism and my views on scripture softened. By the time I graduated, I had a much more nuanced view of scripture. I no longer held to biblical inerrancy, I didn't believe in a literal hell per se, and I accepted the scientific consensus that humans evolved via natural selection. However, I still believed in the physical resurrection of Christ. That doctrine seemed to be a requirement of calling oneself a Christian. I also still held onto the idea that there was a benevolent god who cared about humans and was watching over us.

When I met my wife in 2019, she was volunteering at a hip, Instagram-y, evangelical church in downtown Chicago. At the time, I was working at an older, liberal, mainline protestant church in the Albany Park area. I didn't hide the fact that I thought her church was kind of terrible. I had been exposed to the flashy bullshit of mega churches during my time at Moody and was well aware of the fundamentalist theology that undergirded those places. After we had been dating for several months, she left the church. She said I helped open her eyes to its cult-like nature and started her "deconstruction" process. I was happy for her.

During this deconstruction process, we both were listening to a lot of "post-evangelical" content. Most of this content was from people who still called themselves Christian such as the late Rachel Held Evans, Pete Holmes, and the Liturgists podcast. During this time, I noticed that my wife wasn't afraid of deconstructing as far as needed to get to the bedrock truth. In other words, there weren't any lines she wasn't willing to cross — no sacred cows that she felt obliged to hang onto. Wherever the truth was, that's where she was going. I admired her fearlessness.

One night during the pandemic, after a couple of cocktails and a weed gummy, I asked the embarrassing albeit honest question "how do seasons work again?" She knew it had to do with the tilted axis of the earth but was fuzzy on the details so we pulled up a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/KUU7IyfR34o?si=rqxZS6GYZTAwbhEg) of Bill Nye explaining it. After the video finished, YouTube auto-played an [hour-long video](https://youtu.be/NQ4CUw9RcuA?si=V-Jq1qOnLCmAaO37) on the geological history of the planet earth. We were spellbound to say the least. During the video, my wife said something like “Wow, I think I’m an atheist now”. My response was a mixture of “Woah! Easy tiger!” and “I know right? Science is fucking crazy!” 

That video really made an impression on me. Even though I had long believed in evolution, I hadn’t really let the obvious implications of that fact sink in — namely that God doesn’t play a useful role in the modern scientific understanding of the origins of life on our planet. My wife was just pointing out the obvious — if all of this is true, why do we need to believe in God? My instinct was something like “Sure, but God could have been the one to snap his fingers and set off the Big Bang, right?” But even if that’s true, we’re still left with an incomprehensibly large, cold, hostile, indifferent universe. If there’s a god or spirit or higher power out there that gives a flying fuck about humans, you wouldn’t know it from looking at the data. You need to add the existence of this anthropomorphic entity into the theory — and it feels more like shoehorning him in if we’re being honest. 

By January 2021, I was a full blown atheist. I had begun reading a lot more with all the spare time I had from being home during the lockdown. I started reading Richard Dawkins, Yuval Noah Harari, Dan Dennett, Steven Pinker, Sean Carroll, and David Deutsch (among others). I have to give credit to my lovely wife — while she wasn't quite as obsessed with the philosophical and scientific arguments against God as I was, she recognized the facts as facts and lovingly encouraged me to explore all my intellectual curiosities. It was such a freeing experience to realize that I didn't _have to_ believe in God for my wife to love or respect me. 

I think that was the main reason I had maintained my faith for so long. I couldn't imagine myself as someone who didn't believe in God at all. I didn't _really_ believe in miracles. But who would I be if I admitted that? I basically believed in belief. I think this is true of basically all religious people who accept evolution by natural selection. They say they believe in God, but really it's more of a belief in the value of faith. Now the people who _deny_ evolution, they _definitely_ believe in God. I remember a conversation I had with my mom about evolution where she basically said “but if evolution is true, what role is there for God?” I didn’t realize it at the time, but she was asking exactly the right question. Her delusion was (and still is) the idea that denying the evidence of evolution by natural selection is an intellectually respectable position. It is not. 

But that’s just ignorance on her part. If she actually sat down and read [The God Delusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_Delusion) or [Sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind), she might actually change her mind as I did. Maybe I’m giving her too much credit, but at least she’s aware of the precariousness of her beliefs. Namely, that if science can ultimately account for everything we see around us, there's no good reason to believe in God. To paraphrase Richard Dawkins, “If you don’t believe in the existence of the supernatural, there’s not much point in calling yourself a Christian.”

And this is the really crucial point. The more you investigate our best scientific theories, the more it becomes clear that there is only one world, the natural world, and it is described by the laws of physics. There are many different ways of talking about the world, but it is still just one type of thing at the end of the day. You describe a human being in terms of physics, biology, psychology, sociology and more. But at the end of the day, a human being is literally just a collection of cells, made of molecules, made of atoms, and so on. As Dan Dennett has put it, we are robots, made out of robots, made out of robots, made out of robots. Adding in another "type of thing" is dualism whether that thing is God, [qualia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia), or any other ill-defined ontological category. 

If you want to still believe in God, that’s fine — just answer this question for yourself: “What does god do?” If he does things that are observable/detectable, great! You have nothing to fear and science will soon vindicate you. However if the things he does are _not_ observable or detectable, what makes you so sure that he’s really there? 

I'm sure you can point to events or experiences where you were sure God was present — I know I could. But it's not hard to find evidence that _verifies_ our beliefs. It's much harder to imagine what kind of evidence could ever _falsify_ those beliefs. All it would take to falsify evolution by natural selection is the discovery of an organism on this planet (just one!) that didn't get it's genes from it's parents.

It's true that no one will ever be able to _disprove_ the existence of God. I can’t be sure that God doesn’t exist anymore than I can be sure that vampires don’t exist — neither theory is falsifiable. However, I won’t be saying any prayers tonight or any night in the foreseeable future for the same reason that I won’t be hanging any garlic over my door.
