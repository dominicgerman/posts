In 2020, I stopped believing in God. A few years later in 2023 I stopped believing in alcohol. During that year, I drank dramatically less than I had in over a decade. To my surprise, giving up alcohol, felt eerily similar to giving up belief in God and religion. 

In both cases, I was giving up cherished beliefs after it had become painfully obvious that the data wasn’t on my side.

One of my favorite definitions of health is "accepting reality on reality's terms". In the case of alcohol, I had talked myself into a version of reality where alcohol wasn’t nearly as detrimental to my health as the data would suggest. Here are a few of the  lines I used on myself:

- Your drinking is basically in line with the FDA recommendation of no more than 14 units of alcohol per week.
- There’s nothing wrong with having a glass or two of your favorite whiskey or wine at the end of the day. You deserve that!
- You’re not drinking to get drunk, you’re drinking for the right reasons: the taste, the social benefits, etc.
- Alcohol is part of who you are. You’re the cocktail guy! You’re the whiskey/rum connoisseur! Who would you be without those things?
- Giving up alcohol would be difficult if not impossible.

The last two lines are the most pernicious. Most of the other lines have at least an element of truth, but the last two turned out to be wholly inaccurate.

Now let’s take a look at a few of the lines I used on myself to maintain religious belief:

- Your beliefs about God are intellectually respectable, supported by reason, and widely held.
- There’s nothing wrong with believing in a supernatural realm, a benevolent creator God or an afterlife. These are not philosophically/scientifically problematic.
- Your beliefs aren’t just *convenient* truths, they’re *actually* true! You’re definitely not kidding yourself. 
- Religious belief is an inextricable part of who you are. You’re the theology guy, the Bible school grad, the church employee! Who would you be without these beliefs?
- Giving up belief in the supernatural would be difficult if not impossible.

I said before that the data wasn't on my side. I want to emphasize this because this is really the crux of the issue. In both cases, I was cooking the books to make the numbers work. 

I knew from tracking my alcohol consumption in the past that "14 units" of alcohol is actually quite a lot less than I had assumed. At the time, it took concerted effort to limit myself to 14 a week. Furthermore, I knew that researchers had recently shown that the ADA recommendation should really be cut down to 7 units a week max in order to mitigate cancer risk. As far as your body is concerned, the best amount of alcohol was none.

I also knew that evolution by natural selection was among the most successful scientific theories of all time. I had been taught that it was just "one man's interpretation of fossils" -- presumably analogous to 

Like alcohol, belief in the supernatural is just one of many ways we humans cope with the reality of death. They numb the pain of reality and reassure us that things are fine just the way are. This is not *always* a bad thing -- numbing agents do have their use. But prolonged usage leads to a crippling dependence and an inability to act in ways would that improve the status quo. Put another way, religion and alcohol make life easier in the short term but much harder in the long term.
