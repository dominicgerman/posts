When it comes to belief in the supernatural, there are only three options:

1. You reject _all_ supernatural explanations.
2. You embrace _certain_ supernatural explanations.
3. You withhold judgement on the viability of any given supernatural explanation.

As far as I'm concerned, if you categorically reject supernatural explanations, you're an atheist. If you don't, you're either an agnostic or a believer but you're not an atheist. Agnosticism is often defined as "not knowing if God exists" but that's everybody. I think what people generally mean when they say they're agnostic is something like "I'm skeptical of supernatural explanations but I don't want to rule them out entirely."

I can certainly respect that position. If you haven't thoroughly investigated things, it's best to withhold judgement.

The reason I reject all supernatural explanations is that they can't possibly shed any light on our understanding of reality. They are therefore bad explanations _by definition_. That doesn't mean they're not true, it just means that they add nothing to our understanding of ourselves or the universe as a whole.

But wait... if a supernatural explanation could be true, we shouldn't dismiss it should we? We should just withold judgement, right? What if, say, the Judeo-Christian god really exists? Wouldn't it be a mistake to deny his existence in that case?

Well, no. Becuase you can't ever find out _if_ it's true or not. If you could, it wouldn't be a supernatural theory anymore -- it would be testable. Furthermore, to be consistent, you have to withold judgement on the existence of Thor, Odin, and Zeus as well as fairies, vampires, Santa Claus... you get the idea. If you entertain even just one supernatural theory, you have to entertain _all_ of them becuase they are methodologically and epistemologically identical. If you tell me "God did this or that" how am I supposed to respond when someone else tells me "Odin did this or that"? There's no way to tell the difference between these theories -- not only by experiment, but by _any argument_.

Supernatural theories are logically identical to the theory that we are all living in a computer simulation and that we have no way to access the "true" reality outside. In both theories, there is a fundamental limit on our ability to understand reality. It would also have to be an **arbitrary** limit placed there by the programmer in the case of a simulation or by a god in the case of the supernatural.

It's tempting to think that such a limit might not be arbitrary but rather be due to an underlying limit of our biology or brainpower. Why should we expect to have no limits in our understanding? We're finite creatures, we can't have inifinite knowledge. But this is a misunderstanding of the nature of knowledge. We can't fully understand _anything_. All of our knowledge is conjecture and subject to change. Gödel's theorem shows us that even math isn't grounded in anything beyond axiomatic assumptions -- there is no foundational knowledge in that sense. The laws of arithmentic have the same status as the laws of physics; and yet, we really _can_ know that `x*y = y*x`. Thus our knowledge can only limited by the laws of physics regardless of whether we're zooming in or zooming out. All other barriers are artifical.

## Miracles

For argument's sake, let's assume Jesus was indeed physically raised from the dead. Ok, so how did that work on a physical level? The physics must be understandable _in principle_ — surely it's not a black box to God himself. Furthermore, the process couldn't have broken our known laws of physics because if they can be broken at all, then they're not really laws of physics. If you want to argue that they aren't really laws of physics, that's fine but then you might as claim 2 + 2 = 5. But in that case, it's not _really_ supernatural it's just sufficiently advanced technology.

Imagine you're at a magic show and you see the magician pull a rabbit out of his hat. If you believed that miracles are possible in theory, you're required to acknowledge the possibility that you just witnessed a miracle. If you were unfamiliar with the concept of magic shows, it would be a very natural thing to conclude. The problem with a supernatural explanation is that it's an excuse to stop thinking. It's essentially saying "Let's just give up. We probably _won't_ figure this out so it would be easier to just say that we _can't_ figure it out."

When people say they’re agnostic, I always want to ask them what they mean by that. Traditionally, agnostic mean
