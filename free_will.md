A few years ago, I listened to [an episode](https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/241-final-thoughts-on-free-will) of Sam Harris' podcast _Making Sense_ that really challenged my notions of free will. I had recently begun exploring atheism and Sam Harris was a big part of that journey. If you haven't listened to Sam talk about free will, I highly recommend you do so — he has a bunch of great content on the subject and I was convinced by his arguments for quite a while.

It wasn't until I found Dan Dennett's excelent work on free will that I changed my mind on the subject. I found out that compatabilism was the majority position among scientists and philosophers including some of my new favorite authors like Sean Carroll and Steven Pinker. To this day, I'm convinced that [compatabilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism) is the only coherent position of the bunch. Only since the release of Robert Sapolsky's book _Determined_ have I realized just how many people disagree.

Although I have not read Sapolsky's book, I'm familiar with the general argument and was convinced by it for a long time. It is an appealing idea that everything that has ever happened was in some sense inevitable. Sapolsky and others have suggested that this engenders a certain amount of compassion for our fellow human beings — we're all doing our best after all. This has some pretty severe implications for human moral responsibility. If we are all made of atoms and we can't control what those atoms do, why should we hold criminals responsible for their actions?

The problem with the argument that determinism disproves free will is that it ignores higher-level explanations of the world. It's not the case that for a theory to be true, it must be readily apparent at the lowest level of reality. You can't look at an individual air molecule and find that it is moving through spacetime irreversibly — the motion of an individual particle is [time-reversal invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-symmetry). However if you zoom out one level, you quickly find that the collection of air molecules that you're observing _is_ moving irreversibly due to the second law of thermodynamics.

The best explanations for human behavior are not found at the level of physics. Telling people that they have no real control over their future — it only _feels_ like they do — is misleading and dangerous.

Robert Sapolsky references the story of Phineas Gage, a man whose personality was permanently changed after surviving an accident in which a large iron rod passed through his head. The story is meant to demonstrate how we are completely subject to our brain chemistry. Sapolsky argues that everything we do has some proximate cause and that we're just products of this "distributed causality". But “distributed causality” isn’t causality. If it were, you might as well say that the change in Phineas Gage was more due to his childhood than the iron rod. The whole point of the Phineas Gage example is that in his case, there’s actually an explanation for the change in his behavior. THAT’S why we don’t blame him.

We treat the criminally insane differently than the average person because in those cases, we can point to _specific pathologies_ that have a direct causal relationship to the crime. If removing a tumor removes the criminal behavior of an individual, that’s progress. That’s explanatory knowledge. It wouldn’t add anything to say that the criminal behavior was _also_ caused by the initial low-entropy state of the universe at the Big Bang. That’s a catch-all explanation that can be used to explain anything. Explanations of that sort don’t really explain anything.
