For me, I became an atheist when I took seriously the implications of two beliefs I had long held. 

1) Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection
2) Ghosts aren’t reald

I didn’t believe in evolution until I was in college. I was at Moody so it was a minority position at best. I definitely credit the more liberal theological influences in my life with that one — people like Adam Cieszkiewicz and Joe Ananias. It wasn’t until I watched the “Whole History of the World” video (while high) and subsequently read Sapiens that I started flirting with atheism. Yuval led me to Pinker and then all hell broke loose. I owe Steven Pinker a lot. He turned me onto Sean Carroll, David Deutsch, Richard Dawkins’ book The Selfish Gene and more. 

It took a while for me to realize how devastating Darwin’s discovery was to religious belief including my own. I think Sapiens and that video drove home the reality of the history of life on this planet. After you grapple with that, you’re left thinking “but how? I have so many questions!” And Dawkins, Dennett and others are there to calmly answer those questions. And their answers are extremely compelling. 

Dennett in particular liked to point out just how shocking and revolutionary an idea it was. It was the final piece of the puzzle in explaining the universe in purely mechanical, physical terms. 

The other point about ghosts not being real is more of a philosophical issue at the end of the day. It’s dualism, Occam’s razor, real patterns (can’t make money on ‘em)… all that stuff. Essentially it comes down to the fact that supernatural beings don’t exist because they don’t do anything. I am therefore in some sense, just waiting for God or ghosts or whatever to reveal themselves. But if they did, we would just include them in our description of the natural world as Sean Carroll and others have pointed out. 

Deutsch has since driven my atheism into the realm of near certainty. His logic and thought experiments are so airtight that it basically seems like there’s really world in which “god did it” would be a good explanation.

Your options:
1. You embrace _certain_ supernatural explanations.
2. You reject _all_ supernatural explanations.
3. You withhold judgement on the viability of any given supernatural explanation.

As far as I'm concerned, if you categorically reject supernatural explanations, you're an atheist. If you don't, you're either an agnostic or a believer but you're not an atheist. Agnosticism is often defined as "not knowing if God exists" but that's everybody. I think what people generally mean when they say they're agnostic is something like "I'm skeptical of supernatural explanations but I don't want to rule them out entirely."

I can certainly respect that position. If you haven't thoroughly investigated things, it's best to withhold judgement. 

The reason I reject all supernatural explanations is that they can't possibly shed any light on our understanding of reality. They are therefore bad explanations _by definition_. That doesn't mean they're not true, it just means that they add nothing to our understanding of ourselves or the universe as a whole. But wait... if one of them is true, we wouldn't want to dismiss that theory, right? What if, say, the Judeo-Christian god really exists? Wouldn't it be a mistake to deny his existence in that case?

Well, no.

Consider the theory that we are all living in a computer simulation and that we have no way to access the "true" reality outside the simulation. This is equivalent to believing in the supernatural because in both theories, there is a fundamental limit on our knowledge of reality. If we could break through that limit, then it's not _really_ a limit. And if we really can't break through it, **_why can't we_**? It could only be because someone or something has placed that limit there. In the case of the simulation, that person would be the programmer. In the case of the supernatural, that person would be god.

> **Sidebar**: If there really is a god, how can he be sure that _he's_ not in a simulation? Think about it.

For argument's sake, let's assume Jesus was indeed physically raised from the dead. Ok, so how did that work on a physical level? The physics must be understandable _in principle_ — surely it's not a black box to God himself. Furthermore, the process couldn't have broken our known laws of physics because if they can be broken at all, then they're not really laws of physics. If you want to argue that they aren't really laws of physics, that's fine but then you might as claim 2 + 2 = 5. But in that case, it's not _really_ supernatural it's just sufficiently advanced technology. 

Imagine you're at a magic show and you see the magician pull a rabbit out of his hat. If you believed that miracles are possible in theory, you're required to acknowledge the possibility that you just witnessed a miracle. If you were unfamiliar with the concept of magic shows, it would be a very natural thing to conclude. The problem with a supernatural explanation is that it's an excuse to stop thinking. It's essentially saying "Let's just give up. We probably _won't_ figure this out so it would be easier to just say that we _can't_ figure it out." 

## Agnosticism 

When people say they’re agnostic, I always want to ask them what they mean by that. Traditionally, agnostic mean

I think supernatural explanations are by definition the worst possible explanation one can have on any given topic take for example a magic show. Let’s say you brought a guest to a magic show, and the guest wasn’t familiar with the concept of magicians or magic shows in general. So how comes the magician, and the audience watches him pull a rabbit out of a hat. Now the guest you brought to the show is going to be thrown into a true test of explanations. Magic show is the perfect testing ground for explanations and understanding how they work. Put crudely we all have , working explanations of hats and working explanations of rabbits, and the trick that the magician just showed us in the face of those explanations. It requires a new better explanation now your friend, if they are shrewd may have an instinct that this is some sort of trick they may start considering possibilities of how the magician has tricked us by way of some relatively straightforward. I’ll be at hard to imagine explanation or process. Now, if the guest decides that the best explanation is supernatural in origin, they have closed themselves off to ever getting to the actual answer. A supernatural explanation will never shed any light on what’s really going on. In fact, it can’t shed any light on what’s really going on. If it could, it wouldn’t be a supernatural explanation.
